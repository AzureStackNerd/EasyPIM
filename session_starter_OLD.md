## 📅 Recent Key Updates

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2025-09-03 | **🚨 CRITICAL DRIFT DETECTION FIX**: Discovered and fixed critical bug in `Test-PIMPolicyDrift` where drift detection showed false "Match" results for Azure resource policies. Root cause: drift detection was always querying subscription-level policies while orchestrator applied resource-specific policies, causing scope validation mismatches. Fixed by implementing scope-aware policy validation in drift detection. Orchestrator bumped to v1.2.0. This resolves cases where policies like "Contributor" at storage account scopes failed to apply but drift detection incorrectly reported "Match". |
| 2025-01-25 | **Critical Syntax Fix**: Fixed corrupted `Invoke-ARM.ps1` file that had duplicate code blocks causing parser errors. Removed duplicate try-catch section and extra closing braces. Build validation now passes all 6,973 tests successfully. **Telemetry KeyVault Fix**: Resolved issue where telemetry events were bypassed in CI/CD environments using KeyVault configurations. Created `Send-TelemetryEventFromConfig` function to support config object-based telemetry alongside file-based approach. Modified orchestrator to conditionally send telemetry for both parameter sets. This enables proper usage analytics from GitHub Actions and other automated deployments. |
| 2025-08-31 | **Issue #136 Implementation**: Implemented policy template merge feature allowing users to specify base templates with inline property overrides. Enhanced EntraRoles.Policies, AzureRoles.Policies, and GroupRoles.Policies sections to copy non-Template properties as overrides when Template is specified. **Dependency Optimization**: Removed unnecessary `Microsoft.Graph.Identity.Governance` requirement from orchestrator module after code analysis showed it only uses `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` cmdlets. Updated release notes to v1.1.0 with current status and core dependency alignment. |
| 2025-08-30 | **Issue #137**: Created branch `feature/issue-137-protected-roles-override` to implement -Force flag for overriding protected roles in orchestrator. Issue #138 confirmed resolved in v2.0.5. |
| 2025-08-29 | **CI/CD Reliability**: Added proactive Gallery version checking to prevent repeated pipeline failures. Core bumped to v2.0.5. |
| 2025-08-29 | **Documentation**: Updated Step-by-step Guide for module split architecture with installation and authentication guidance. |
| 2025-08-28 | **Stable Release**: Promoted to stable versions, removed prerelease tags. Module separation milestone achieved. |
| 2025-08-27 | **Architecture**: Module split completed with clean internal function duplication, no shared dependencies. |

## 🧠 Assistant Memory

### Key Technical Lessons
- **Gallery Conflicts**: Always check version availability before building
- **Module Loading**: Use explicit paths for development vs PSGallery versions
- **Function Architecture**: All referenced functions must exist in module structure
- **CI/CD Reliability**: Fail-fast approach saves development time

### Development Pattern
- Use `.\build\vsts-build.ps1` for core module builds with Gallery checking
- Use `.\EasyPIM.Orchestrator\build\vsts-build-orchestrator.ps1` for orchestrator builds
- Tag format: `core-vX.Y.Z` and `orchestrator-vX.Y.Z` for CI/CD triggers
- Always validate locally before pushing tags

## 🧠 Assistant Memory

**Current Understanding:**
The EasyPIM module provides comprehensive PIM management capabilities. The project has a well-structured codebase with functions for Azure Resources, Entra Roles, and Groups. It includes export/import functionality.

**Known Constraints or Requirements:**
- Must follow PowerShell best practices and pass PSScriptAnalyzer checks
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- All changes need unit tests
- GitHub Actions pipeline must pass
- Code must be properly documented with comment-based help

**🎯 CRITICAL TECHNICAL PROTOCOLS** (MUST FOLLOW IN ALL SESSIONS):

1. **DOCUMENTATION-FIRST APPROACH** 📚
   - **ALWAYS** search Microsoft documentation FIRST using `mcp_microsoft_doc_microsoft_docs_search` before attempting fixes
   - **NEVER** guess or trial-and-error for PowerShell Gallery, module manifest, or Azure API limitations
   - **VERIFY** technical constraints and supported scenarios in official docs before implementation
   - **EXAMPLE**: PowerShell RequiredModules field does NOT support prerelease versions (System.Version limitation)

2. **ERROR MESSAGE ANALYSIS**
   - Parse exact error messages for API limitations, type conversion issues, or version conflicts
   - Cross-reference error details with Microsoft documentation to understand root causes
   - Use error details as search terms in documentation queries

3. **SYSTEMATIC TROUBLESHOOTING SEQUENCE**
   - Step 1: Search official documentation for the specific technology/error
   - Step 2: Analyze documented limitations and supported scenarios
   - Step 3: Implement solution based on documented best practices
   - Step 4: Validate implementation against documentation requirements

**Recent Critical Learning**: PowerShell module manifests' `RequiredModules` field uses `System.Version` type which cannot parse prerelease versions like "2.0.0-beta1". Must use base version "2.0.0" in manifest dependencies even when targeting prerelease packages.

  - ✅ **Corrected Execution Flow**: Orchestrator now processes policies first → cleanup → assignments to ensure compliance
- **Technical Achievement**: The orchestrator now provides enterprise-ready policy and assignment management with proper workflow order ensuring assignments comply with established role policies
- **Recent Fix**: Corrected configuration schema - `PolicyMode` is a function parameter, not part of the PolicyConfig object structure

**Current Session Context:**
- Progressive Validation Steps 0–5 completed (backup, protected users, Entra policies inline & template, legacy import note, assignments WhatIf simulation).
- validation.json synchronized with documentation Step 5 snippet (templates Standard/PT2H + HighSecurity, Entra role policies Guest Inviter, tesrole, User Administrator, assignments eligible + active + permanent eligible).
- Principal display name resolution added to assignment WhatIf output (ID with display name parentheses).

## 🎯 Current Focus: CI Pipeline & Quality Assurance

**✅ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT - ALL CI TESTS PASSING!**

### Run Conventions (hard rules)
- Always use environment variables for cloud context: `$env:TENANTID` and `$env:SUBSCRIPTIONID`. Do NOT use dummy IDs.
- Prefer -WhatIf for validation unless the user explicitly asks to apply changes.
- When reproducing user issues, mirror their exact command line, parameters, and casing.
- Next action: Extend validation.json with AzureRoles.Policies (e.g., Owner or Contributor) with Scope and run orchestrator -WhatIf -SkipAssignments to confirm Planned policy updates.

## 🔄 Update Log

| Date       | Summary of Update                                      |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-08-29 | **🚀 CI/CD RELIABILITY REVOLUTION**: Implemented systematic solution to prevent repeated PowerShell Gallery version conflicts that were causing pipeline frustration. ✅ **PROACTIVE VERSION CHECKING**: Added early Gallery conflict detection to both build scripts (core & orchestrator) using Find-Module - fails fast with clear guidance before any build investment ✅ **VERSION MANAGEMENT**: Bumped EasyPIM core from 2.0.4 → 2.0.5 after Gallery check caught existing version conflict ✅ **BUILD VALIDATION**: Confirmed new version checking works perfectly - build succeeded with "✅ Version 2.0.5 is available for publish" message ✅ **STABLE RELEASE**: Created and pushed tag core-v2.0.5 to trigger CI/CD publication ✅ **SYSTEMATIC IMPROVEMENT**: Replaced reactive "one-time fixes" with proactive fail-fast approach that saves development time and prevents future frustration. **KEY INSIGHT**: Gallery version conflicts now detected early in build process, eliminating wasted CI cycles and repeated pipeline failures! |
| 2025-08-29 | **✅ PUBLICATION SUCCESS STRATEGY**: Resolved PowerShell Gallery "version already exists" error by implementing proper version management workflow. Added comprehensive building & publishing documentation to session starter with prerequisites, step-by-step procedures, common issues, and validation workflows. Bumped EasyPIM.Orchestrator from v1.0.3-beta1 to v1.0.4-beta1 and triggered workflow. Build script fixes from previous session (path corrections, Export-ModuleMember preservation) now properly validated. **STATUS**: Orchestrator v1.0.4-beta1 publishing in progress with corrected build process. |
| 2025-01-25 | **✅ STRATEGIC PIVOT: STABLE RELEASE APPROACH**: After multiple attempts to resolve PowerShellGet prerelease dependency issues, implemented superior strategy: promote EasyPIM from v2.0.0-beta1 to v2.0.0 stable release. Removed Prerelease='beta1' from EasyPIM.psd1, updated orchestrator to depend on stable EasyPIM v2.0.0, removed -AllowPrerelease flags from build scripts, updated workflows to use stable versions. This eliminates all System.Version constraints and prerelease dependency resolution issues. Created core-v2.0.0 tag to trigger stable publication. Key insight: sometimes changing the problem is better than fighting the constraints. ARM API fixes remain. Clean, standard PowerShell Gallery publication approach. |
| 2025-08-27 | **✅ ORCHESTRATOR HARDENING COMPLETED**: Implemented clean internal function duplication approach for EasyPIM.Orchestrator. Resolved InvalidRoleAssignmentRequest errors by fixing JSON structure in New-PIMEntraRoleActiveAssignment. Eliminated complex shared module loading in favor of simple internal function duplication (Write-SectionHeader, invoke-graph, Test-PrincipalExists, Initialize-EasyPIMPolicies, Get-PIMAzureEnvironmentEndpoint). Removed EasyPIM.Shared dependency from orchestrator manifest. Internal functions properly scoped within module (not globally accessible by design). All orchestrator public functions work correctly. Created GitHub Actions workflow to validate module loading in CI/CD environments. Branch `chore/orchestrator-hardening` ready for merge. |
| 2025-08-26 | **✅ ORCHESTRATOR ASSIGNMENT PROCESSING COMPLETED**: Resolved orchestrator assignment creation issues by fixing module loading conflicts between installed PSGallery modules and local development versions. Enhanced group assignment functions with principalID parameter support and proper WhatIf compatibility. Implemented user-friendly colored logging (⏭️ Yellow for skipped existing assignments, ✅ Green for successful creation, ❌ Red for failures) making assignment operations visible without requiring -Verbose flag. All core orchestration functionality now working correctly including idempotency checks, operations filtering, and clear operational feedback. |
| 2025-08-26 | **✅ CORE MODULE CLEANUP**: Manually removed duplicate files from core EasyPIM module (Get-PIMAzureEnvironmentEndpoint.ps1, New-EasyPIMPolicies.ps1) that were moved to shared/orchestrator modules. This should resolve verbose logging conflicts by ensuring orchestrator uses the shared module version with verbose suppression fixes. Additional duplicates remain: Initialize-EasyPIMPolicies.ps1 and Test-PrincipalExists.ps1. |
| 2025-08-26 | **✅ VERBOSE OUTPUT ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed excessive verbose logging in orchestrator by adding -Verbose:$false to internal calls to Get-PIMAzureEnvironmentEndpoint from Test-PrincipalExists, Test-GroupEligibleForPIM, Invoke-graph, and Invoke-ARM functions. Orchestrator now runs cleanly without unwanted verbose messages unless explicitly requested with -Verbose flag. |
| 2025-08-26 | Removed lingering Core stubs (Initialize-EasyPIMPolicies.ps1, New-EasyPIMAssignments.ps1) to enforce strict module boundaries: Shared owns common helpers; Orchestrator owns EPO*/assignments; Core contains no orchestrator/shared duplicates. |
| 2025-08-26 | Fixed Assignments pre-check prompting by passing -tenantID from orchestrator to Get-PIMEntraRolePolicy; imports remain quiet (version banner only). |
| 2025-08-26 | Enforced orchestrator-only boundaries: removed core dependency checks from cleanup, made cleanup fully orchestrator-owned; moved New-EasyPIMAssignments to orchestrator internals and added a non-exported core stub that forwards when orchestrator is loaded; fixed group param (-type) and -WhatIf support in deferred policies. |
| 2025-08-25 | Orchestrator publish confirmed on PSGallery; previous 409 due to existing 0.1.0-beta10 explains failure on one run. Created branch `chore/orchestrator-hardening` to continue work off main. Updated validate workflow to trigger on shared/ changes. |
| 2025-08-25 | Core export boundary enforced: added explicit Export-ModuleMember whitelist in `EasyPIM.psm1` and loader filter to skip orchestrator-owned EPO* files (New-EPO*/Set-EPO*/Invoke-EPO*). Pester suite PASS (8.5k). Follow-up: optionally delete unused EPO* files from core tree. |
| 2025-08-25 | Orchestrator prerelease bumped to 0.1.0-beta7; added internal Write-SectionHeader and Initialize-EasyPIMAssignments shims; all tests passing locally; tag orchestrator-v0.1.0-beta7 pushed to trigger CI/publish. |
| 2025-08-25 | Fixed Pester -Fast mode by adding safe fallback when Run.Parallel isn’t available; hardened file encoding test for empty files; excluded _REMOVED_SHIMS_BACKUP from tests; moved Write-EasyPIMSummary into EasyPIM.Orchestrator internals (no cross-module dot-sourcing); corrected Orchestrator manifest version (0.1.0 + Prerelease beta4) and exports (Invoke-EasyPIMOrchestrator, Test-PIMPolicyDrift, Test-PIMEndpointDiscovery); added basic Orchestrator Pester test; all tests passing. |
| 2025-08-23 | Phase 2 of module split completed: moved Invoke-EasyPIMOrchestrator and Test-PIMPolicyDrift implementations to new EasyPIM.Orchestrator module; kept wrappers in Core for back-compat; Orchestrator manifest finalized (GUID, RequiredModules=EasyPIM, limited exports). Removed all references to obsolete 'validate' mode; standardize on -WhatIf. Fast Pester run PASS (~8.4k). Opened PR #133. |
| 2025-08-24 | Enforced no dot-sourcing across module trees. Exported minimal EPO* helpers from EasyPIM (Write-EasyPIMSummary, Initialize-*, New-EPOEasyPIMPolicy, Invoke-EasyPIMCleanup, New-EasyPIMAssignments, Invoke-EPODeferredGroupPolicies, Test-PrincipalExists, Invoke-Graph, Show-EasyPIMUsage, Write-SectionHeader). Removed Orchestrator's dot-sourcing of core files and deleted duplicated EPO_New-CommandMap from Orchestrator/internal (use Core implementation). |
| 2025-08-19 | Repo snapshot captured and release alignment pending: Stars 176, Forks 15, Watchers 176, Subscribers 7; Open issues 3, Closed issues 48; Merged PRs 68, Open PRs 0; Latest GitHub release tag V1.1.0 (behind module v1.9.2). Next: publish v1.9.2 to PSGallery (if not yet), create GitHub Release v1.9.2 with notes. |
| 2025-08-21 | Fixed Entra policy PATCH failures: robust primaryApprovers coercion (DOTALL regex), enforced MFA removal whenever Authentication Context is enabled (including live policy check). Validated non-WhatIf run applies 3 Entra policies without errors. |
| 2025-08-21 | Resolved regression in legacy Set-PIMEntraRolePolicy: corrected serializer to use actual newlines (not literal \n), added decoding of JSON-encoded rule strings, and fragment-splitting fallback. Legacy cmdlet path now compatible again. |
| 2025-08-21 | Orchestrator improvement: Pre-validate approver principal IDs referenced in Entra role policies and surface missing IDs with role context before PATCH to avoid InvalidPolicy. |
| 2025-08-21 | Fixed Entra Approval and Eligibility rule schemas: approvers now use Graph subject sets with @odata.type and userId/groupId (no userType/description), and eligibility durations normalize PnY to PnD; CSV paths updated too. Added verbose markers for branch execution. Next: rerun orchestrator per-rule diagnostics to confirm InvalidPolicy resolved. |
| 2025-08-21 | Version bump to v1.9.3. AC/MFA harmonization finalized, approval subject sets and eligibility normalization shipped, notification boolean fix, enhanced diagnostics, analyzer/whitespace cleanup. All 9052 tests passing. PR #128 updated. |
| 2025-08-21 | Orchestrator docs updated: added Policy processing section, new parameters (PolicyOperations, SkipPolicies, WouldRemoveExportPath), examples for policies-only runs, and diagnostics note for InvalidPolicy isolation. |
| 2025-08-21 | Documented mono-repo split plan for EasyPIM.Orchestrator: see EasyPIM/Documentation/Development/Orchestrator-Module-Split-Plan.md |
| 2025-08-22 | Group policies: AuthenticationContext_* is ignored for Groups (pre-validation warning + WhatIf note); prevents Graph InvalidPolicy on Group roleManagementPolicies. Docs updated (Step-by-step-Guide). Branch: fix/group-policy-authctx-guard pushed. |
| 2025-08-22 | Group policy apply fixes: flattened Notifications for Groups to Notification_* and normalized Activation/Active requirements to string arrays; Set-PIMGroupPolicy now receives valid parameters. All 9052 tests still passing. |
| 2025-08-22 | Patch v1.9.4: Filter null rules before PATCH and during isolation; ensure Failed counter increments on apply errors; isolation runs only after a global PATCH failure. Updated PR. |
| 2025-08-22 | Added publish/RELEASE-v1.9.4.md and pushed updates to open PR branch fix/group-policy-authctx-guard. |
| 2025-08-10 | Validated Progressive Validation Step 10.2 (assignments-only run with -SkipPolicies). Delta mode confirmed non-destructive; removed obsolete Step 10.2b; Key Vault guidance consolidated under new Step 11c. |
| 2025-08-09 | Validated Progressive Validation Step 5 (Entra role assignments) with multi-assignment WhatIf output, principal display name resolution, and synced validation.json snippet. Ready for Step 6 Azure role policy inline. |
| 2025-08-09 | Updated Progressive Validation Guide Step 10: replaced outdated "validate-only" group policy note with full policy + assignment support, added diff/template examples. |
| 2025-08-08 | Added Progressive-Validation-Guide.md with a safe, step-by-step WhatIf-first runbook. Aligned tutorial and Enhanced Policy Usage docs with actual parameters (no PolicyMode), standardized ActivationRequirement names, and cleaned examples. |
| 2025-08-06 | **🎉 CRITICAL CI/CD FIX - V1.9.0 READY FOR RELEASE**: Resolved Unicode encoding issues causing GitHub CI failures. The issue was emoji characters (🔧, 🛡️, ✅, ⚠️, etc.) in PowerShell code being encoded as Unicode surrogate pairs, causing parser failures in CI environment.

Fixed Import-PIMAzureResourcePolicy parameter issue. Complete workflow now operates correctly with compliance messaging. |
| 2025-08-06 | **CRITICAL SYNTAX ERROR RESOLVED**: Fixed corrupted comment block in New-EasyPIMPolicies.ps1 that was causing CI/CD failures. Balanced braces and verified PowerShell syntax validation. Build process now completes successfully. v1.9.0 release unblocked! |
| 2025-08-11 | Created branch fix/issue-121-authentication-context-import. Implemented AuthenticationContext mapping in Import-EntraRoleSettings (and Azure Import-Settings for parity). Added Pester tests to validate Set-AuthenticationContext rule generation from CSV. |
| 2025-08-18 | Issue #121 update: Confirmed via docs MFA and Authentication Context can be used together. Reverted import logic to not strip MFA and not force empty enablement when AuthenticationContext is enabled. |

| 2025-08-19 | Follow-up: Simplified behavior. MFA is always removed when Authentication Context is enabled to avoid MfaAndAcrsConflict (no toggle). Branch `fix/issue-121-followup` updated. |

### Module Split (Core + Orchestrator) – Next Steps
- [x] Phase 2: Move implementations to EasyPIM.Orchestrator; wrappers in Core
- [x] PR opened: #133
- [x] Enforce boundary in Core (no EPO* exports; loader skip)
- [ ] Review/merge PR #133
- [ ] After merge: clean obsolete branches listed in repo (orchestrator, orchestrator-cleaning, orchestrator-rework, reporting, Approval, etc.)
- [ ] Follow-up: optional Help tests fixes (examples/param help) or keep opt-in

**🎉 CRITICAL CI/CD ISSUE RESOLVED:**
- [x] ✅ **Unicode Encoding Fixed**: Replaced emoji characters with ASCII equivalents to prevent parser failures
- [x] ✅ **Build Process Enhanced**: Improved file concatenation with proper encoding handling
- [x] ✅ **All Tests Passing**: GitHub CI now passes all 8023 validation tests
- [x] ✅ **PSScriptAnalyzer Compliance**: Configured rule exclusions for orchestrator patterns
- [x] ✅ **UTF-8 BOM Issues Resolved**: Fixed encoding issues across all source files

**LESSONS LEARNED - CRITICAL FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:**

⚠️ **CRITICAL MODULE ARCHITECTURE DISCOVERY (2025-08-27)**:
- **Missing Core Functions**: The core EasyPIM module was missing essential `invoke-graph` and `Invoke-ARM` functions that were referenced throughout the codebase but never defined. These functions are absolutely critical for the module to work.
- **Function Discovery Pattern**: Always verify that referenced functions actually exist in the module structure. Functions called but not defined will cause runtime failures.
- **Internal Function Architecture**: When implementing internal function duplication, ensure all required utilities are actually present in each module that needs them.

⚠️ **SHARED MODULE ELIMINATION LESSONS (2025-08-27)**:
- **User Intent Priority**: When users explicitly request removal of components (like shared modules), follow through completely rather than trying to preserve complex dependencies.
- **Clean Duplication Approach**: Simple internal function duplication is more reliable than complex shared module loading, especially for CI/CD environments.
- **Module Boundary Clarity**: Each module should contain all functions it needs internally, with clear boundaries and no cross-module dependencies for core functionality.

⚠️ **PT0S PREVENTION SYSTEM (2025-08-27)**:
- **Zero Duration Protection**: Always validate that assignment durations are not zero (PT0S) as this causes ExpirationRule validation failures in Azure PIM.
- **Minimum Duration Standards**: Use PT5M minimum for active assignments and P1D minimum for eligible assignments to prevent policy validation errors.
- **Template Validation**: Ensure policy templates cannot produce zero-duration values that would break assignment operations.

⚠️ **Unicode Character Issue**: Emoji and special Unicode characters (🔧, 🛡️, ✅, ⚠️, etc.) in PowerShell source files can cause CI/CD parser failures even when they work locally. Always use ASCII equivalents in production code.

⚠️ **Module Loading Priority**: When developing local modules that conflict with installed PSGallery versions, use explicit Import-Module with full paths to ensure local development versions take precedence. Check (Get-Command FunctionName).ScriptBlock.File to verify correct module source.

⚠️ **Assignment Processing Architecture**: Group PIM assignment functions require principalID and type parameters for proper idempotency checking. Enhanced logging with colored output (Write-Host with colors) provides better user experience than verbose-only logging for operational tools.

## � Building & Publishing Guide

### **Critical Prerequisites**

1. **Environment Variables**:
   ```powershell
   # Required for PowerShell Gallery publishing
   $env:APIKEY = "your-powershellgallery-api-key"
   ```

2. **Version Management**:
   - **NEVER** republish existing versions - PowerShell Gallery prevents this
   - **ALWAYS** bump version before publishing
   - For prerelease: increment base version AND keep Prerelease tag (e.g., 1.0.3 → 1.0.4 + 'beta1')
   - For stable: remove Prerelease field entirely

### **EasyPIM Core Module Publication**

```powershell
# 1. Update version in manifest
# Edit EasyPIM/EasyPIM.psd1 - bump ModuleVersion (e.g., 2.0.1 → 2.0.2)

# 2. Local build validation (recommended)
.\build\vsts-build.ps1 -SkipPublish

# 3. Build and publish
.\build\vsts-build.ps1 -ApiKey $env:APIKEY

# 4. Alternative: GitHub Actions (preferred for CI/CD)
git tag core-v2.0.2  # Triggers build-core-tag.yml workflow
git push origin core-v2.0.2
```

### **EasyPIM.Orchestrator Module Publication**

```powershell
# 1. Update version in manifest
# Edit EasyPIM.Orchestrator/EasyPIM.Orchestrator.psd1 - bump ModuleVersion

# 2. Local build validation (recommended)
.\EasyPIM.Orchestrator\build\vsts-build-orchestrator.ps1 -SkipPublish

# 3. Build and publish
.\EasyPIM.Orchestrator\build\vsts-build-orchestrator.ps1 -ApiKey $env:APIKEY

# 4. Alternative: GitHub Actions (preferred for CI/CD)
gh workflow run build-orchestrator.yml  # Manual trigger
# OR commit changes to trigger automatic build
```

### **Version Bump Examples**

**Scenario 1: Orchestrator Patch Release**
```powershell
# Current: v1.0.4-beta1 exists on gallery → ERROR!
# Solution: Bump to v1.0.5-beta1
ModuleVersion = '1.0.5'    # In .psd1
Prerelease = 'beta1'       # Keep prerelease tag
```

**Scenario 2: Core Stable Release**
```powershell
# Current: v2.0.1 → Next: v2.0.2
ModuleVersion = '2.0.2'    # In .psd1
# Prerelease = 'beta1'     # REMOVE this line for stable
```

### **Build Script Architecture**

**Core Build (`build/vsts-build.ps1`)**:
- Flattens module structure into single `.psm1` file
- Preserves `Export-ModuleMember` statements
- Validates syntax before publishing
- Handles UTF-8 BOM encoding requirements

**Orchestrator Build (`EasyPIM.Orchestrator/build/vsts-build-orchestrator.ps1`)**:
- Embeds internal functions (`Write-SectionHeader`, `Initialize-EasyPIMPolicies`)
- Extracts and preserves Export-ModuleMember statements
- Validates module import to catch syntax errors
- Uses correct module output paths (`$moduleOutDir.FullName`)

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `version 'X.Y.Z' is already available` | Version already published | Bump version in manifest |
| `Cannot find path` | Incorrect build script paths | Use `$moduleOutDir.FullName` not `$WorkingDirectory` |
| Syntax errors in generated `.psm1` | Export-ModuleMember extraction issues | Simplify regex, avoid complex try/finally blocks |
| Missing internal functions | Functions not embedded in build | Verify internal functions copied to output |

### **Validation Workflow**

**Before Publishing**:
1. ✅ Run local build with `-SkipPublish` flag
2. ✅ Test module import: `Import-Module ./output/ModuleName`
3. ✅ Verify function availability: `Get-Command -Module ModuleName`
4. ✅ Check for syntax errors in generated `.psm1`
5. ✅ Validate dependencies resolve correctly

**After Publishing**:
1. ✅ Verify module appears on PowerShell Gallery
2. ✅ Test installation: `Install-Module ModuleName -Force`
3. ✅ Validate functionality in clean environment

### **GitHub Actions Integration**

**Core Module**: Tag-based publishing (`build-core-tag.yml`)
- Triggered by tags matching `core-v*` pattern
- Automatically builds and publishes to PowerShell Gallery
- Uses repository secrets for API key

**Orchestrator Module**: Manual/commit-based (`build-orchestrator.yml`)
- Manual trigger: `gh workflow run build-orchestrator.yml`
- Automatic trigger on orchestrator file changes
- Validates dependencies before publishing
