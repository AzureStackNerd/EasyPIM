## Introduction

EasyPIM is a PowerShell module created to help you manage Microsof Privileged Identity Management (PIM) either working with Entra ID, Azure RBAC or groups.  
Packed with more than 30 cmdlets, EasyPIM leverages the ARM and Graph APIs complexity to let you configure PIM **Azure Resources**, **Entra Roles** and **groups** settings and assignments in a simple way .  
üÜï V1.9 Improves our Invoke-EasyPIMOrchestrator, you go-to way if you want to manage you PIM model from a config file.

Quick start: Progressive validation runbook ‚Üí `EasyPIM/Documentation/Progressive-Validation-Guide.md`

### Orchestrator Modes (Assignments)
`delta` (default) now performs only additive / update operations for assignments (no removals). Any existing assignments not represented in your configuration are reported in the summary as `WouldRemove (delta)` but are left intact. Use this mode for safe iterative rollout.

`initial` performs full reconciliation: assignments not present in the configuration (and not listed under `ProtectedUsers`) are removed. Always review a `-WhatIf` run first and ensure `ProtectedUsers` is populated before using this mode.

Policies are always applied (or validated with `-WhatIf`) regardless of mode; modes affect assignment pruning only.

NEW: Preview removal export
- Use `-WouldRemoveExportPath <folder-or-file>` with `-WhatIf` to generate a JSON (or CSV if the path ends in .csv) containing every assignment that would be removed in an `initial` reconcile. The file is written even during preview for audit and peer review.
```pwsh
Invoke-EasyPIMOrchestrator -ConfigFilePath .\pim-config.json -TenantId <tenant> -SubscriptionId <sub> -Mode initial -WhatIf -WouldRemoveExportPath .\LOGS
```
Result example: `LOGS/EasyPIM-WouldRemove-20250811T134338.json`

### Automatic principal validation
The orchestrator now ALWAYS validates that every `principalId` / `groupId` exists (and that groups used for Entra role assignments are role‚Äëassignable) before doing any policy or assignment work. If any invalid or non role‚Äëassignable objects are found the run aborts with a summary so you can correct the IDs.

## Key features
:boom: Support editing multiple roles at once
:boom: Copy settings from one role to another
:boom: Copy eligible assignments from one user to another
:boom: Export role settings to csv
:boom: Import role settings from csv
:boom: Backup all roles
:boom: New in V1.6 get PIM activity reporting
:boom: New in V1.7 Approve/Deny pending requests
:fire: V1.8.1 Invoke-EasyPIMOrchestrator :fire: [more info](https://github.com/kayasax/EasyPIM/wiki/Invoke%E2%80%90EasyPIMOrchestrator)

## Sample usage

*Note: EasyPIM manage PIM Azure Resource settings **at the subscription level by default** : enter a tenant ID, a subscription ID, a role name
then the options you want to set, for example require justification on activation.
If you want to manage the role at another level (Management Group, Resource Group or Resource) please use the `scope` parameter instead of the `subscriptionID`.*


:large_blue_diamond: Get configuration of the Azure Resources roles reader and Webmaster
 ```pwsh
 Get-PIMAzureResourcePolicy -TenantID $tenantID -SubscriptionId $subscriptionID -rolename "reader","webmaster"
 ```

:large_blue_diamond: Require justification, ticketing and MFA when activating the Entra Role testrole
 ```pwsh
 Set-PIMEntraRolePolicy -tenantID $tenantID -rolename "testrole"  -ActivationRequirement "Justification","Ticketing","MultiFactorAuthentication"
 ```

:large_blue_diamond: Require approval and set approvers for Azure roles webmaster and contributor
```pwsh
Set-PIMAzureResourcePolicy -TenantID $tenantID -SubscriptionId $subscriptionID -rolename "webmaster","contributor" -Approvers  @(@{"Id"="00b34bb3-8a6b-45ce-a7bb-c7f7fb400507";"Name"="John";"Type"="user"}) -ApprovalRequired $true
```

:large_blue_diamond: Set maximum activation duration to 4h for the member role of a group
```pwsh
Set-PIMGroupPolicy -tenantID $tenantID -groupID "ba6af9bf-6b28-4799-976e-ff71aed3a1bd" -type member -ActivationDuration "PT4H"
```

:large_blue_diamond: Get a reporting of the PIM activities based on Entra ID Audit logs
```pwsh
$r=Show-PIMReport -tenantID $tenantID
```

:large_blue_diamond: List all eligible assignments for Azure roles
```pwsh
 Get-PIMAzureResourceEligibleAssignment -tenantID $tenantID -subscriptionID $subscriptionId
```

:large_blue_diamond: Create an active assignment for a principal and the Entra role testrole

## Requirement
* Az.Accounts module
* Permission:
The PIM API for Azure resource roles is developed on top of the Azure Resource Manager framework.

You will also need to make sure the user or the service principal calling the API has at least the Owner or User Access Administrator role on the resource you are trying to administer.
* an administrator must grant consent these permissions to the Microsoft Graph PowerShell application:
"RoleManagementPolicy.ReadWrite.Directory",
                "RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory",
                "RoleManagementPolicy.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup",
                "PrivilegedEligibilitySchedule.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup",
                "PrivilegedAssignmentSchedule.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup",
                "PrivilegedAccess.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup"
