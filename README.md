# EasyPIM V1.0.2
Powershell module to manage PIM Azure Resource Role settings with simplicity in mind.

Easily manage PIM Azure Resource settings **at the subscription level by default** : enter a tenant ID, a subscription ID, a role name 
then the options you want to set, for example require justification on activation.  
:new: If you want to manage the role at another level (Management Group, Resource Group or Resource) please use the `scope` parameter instead of the `subscriptionID`.

## Key features
:boom: Support editing multiple roles at once  
:boom: Copy settings from another role  
:boom: Export role settings to csv  
:boom: Import role settings from csv  
:boom: Backup all roles  

With the export function you can now edit your PIM settings in Excel then import back your changes :wink:
