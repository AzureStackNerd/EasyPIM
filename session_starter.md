## üß† Assistant Memory

**Current Understanding:**
The EasyPIM module provides comprehensive PIM management capabilities. The project has a well-structured codebase with functions for Azure Resources, Entra Roles, and Groups. It includes export/import functionality, but there's currently a bug in the import process for Entra Role settings.

**Known Constraints or Requirements:**
- Must follow PowerShell best practices and pass PSScriptAnalyzer checks
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- All changes need unit tests
- GitHub Actions pipeline must pass
- Code must be properly documented with comment-based help

**Current Enhancement Project:**
**Feature: EasyPIM v1.9.0 - Orchestrator System Complete** - **üéâ PRODUCTION READY - CI PASSING!**
- **Objective**: Complete policy orchestration system with enterprise-grade reliability
- **üö® CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed Unicode encoding issues causing CI/CD failures
- **üéØ ROOT CAUSE**: Emoji characters (üîß, üõ°Ô∏è, ‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üìã, etc.) in PowerShell code were encoded as Unicode surrogate pairs, causing PowerShell parser failures in GitHub CI environment (but not locally)
- **‚úÖ SOLUTION**: Replaced all Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents ([PROC], [PROTECTED], [OK], [WARNING], [INFO], etc.)
- **‚úÖ VALIDATION**: All 8023 tests now pass successfully in both local and CI environments
- **Status**: **READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT** üöÄ
- **Status**: All syntax errors resolved, build validation passing, ready for production deployment
  - ‚úÖ **Invoke-EasyPIMOrchestrator**: Comprehensive PIM management cmdlet with unified configuration
  - ‚úÖ **Policy Templates**: Reusable configuration system with inheritance and variable resolution
  - ‚úÖ **Execution Flow**: Corrected order (policies ‚Üí cleanup ‚Üí assignments) for compliance
  - ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Robust Graph API error handling with graceful continuation
  - ‚úÖ **Compatibility**: PowerShell 5.1 support, CSV format compatibility (Azure/Entra differences)
  - ‚úÖ **Environment Integration**: Support for $env:TENANTID and $env:SUBSCRIPTIONID
  - ‚úÖ **Validation Mode**: Complete WhatIf support for safe configuration testing
  - ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed progress tracking and summary output
  - ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Tested with intermittent API failures, handles real-world scenarios

**üìà Version Update**: Module version updated to 1.9.0 with comprehensive release notes
- **Completed Enhancements**:
  - ‚úÖ **Template Resolution Fixed**: WhatIf shows actual resolved values (PT2H activation, P30D eligibility) from templates instead of empty fields
  - ‚úÖ **Assignment Schema Fixed**: Updated to use principalId (Object ID) instead of principalName for proper Azure AD integration
  - ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Schema Documentation**: Created Configuration-Schema.md with complete validation rules and migration guidance
  - ‚úÖ **Enhanced Assignment WhatIf**: Assignment WhatIf now shows detailed information including principal (name + Object ID), role, scope, assignment type, duration, and justification
  - ‚úÖ **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: Supports both old and new formats during transition
  - ‚úÖ **Intuitive Interface**: Standard PowerShell -WhatIf parameter provides comprehensive what-if analysis for both policies and assignments
  - ‚úÖ **Corrected Execution Flow**: Orchestrator now processes policies first ‚Üí cleanup ‚Üí assignments to ensure compliance
- **Technical Achievement**: The orchestrator now provides enterprise-ready policy and assignment management with proper workflow order ensuring assignments comply with established role policies
- **Recent Fix**: Corrected configuration schema - `PolicyMode` is a function parameter, not part of the PolicyConfig object structure

**Current Session Context:**
- Progressive Validation Steps 0‚Äì5 completed (backup, protected users, Entra policies inline & template, legacy import note, assignments WhatIf simulation).
- validation.json synchronized with documentation Step 5 snippet (templates Standard/PT2H + HighSecurity, Entra role policies Guest Inviter, tesrole, User Administrator, assignments eligible + active + permanent eligible).
- Principal display name resolution added to assignment WhatIf output (ID with display name parentheses).
- All Pester tests (8122) passing after enhancements; analyzer clean.
- Ready to begin Step 6: Azure role policy (inline) WhatIf validation using -SkipAssignments.
- Next action: Extend validation.json with AzureRoles.Policies (e.g., Owner or Contributor) with Scope and run orchestrator -WhatIf -SkipAssignments to confirm Planned policy updates.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- ‚úÖ Core policy management functions (Initialize-EasyPIMPolicies, New-EasyPIMPolicies)
- ‚úÖ Template system with 4 predefined templates (HighSecurity, Standard, LowPrivilege, ExecutiveApproval)
- ‚úÖ Approver resolution and configuration support
- ‚úÖ Complete policy settings support including:
  - Authentication context (AuthenticationContext_Enabled, AuthenticationContext_Value)
  - Comprehensive notification settings for all events (eligibility, activation, active assignment)
  - All activation requirements and duration settings
  - Assignment limits and permanent assignment controls
- ‚úÖ CSV conversion functionality (ConvertTo-PolicyCSV, ConvertFrom-PolicyCSV)
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing Invoke-EasyPIMOrchestrator workflow
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing framework with step-by-step guide
- ‚úÖ Template parameter mapping aligned with Set-PIMEntraRolePolicy function parameters
- **Scope**: Complete support for Azure Resources, Entra Roles, and Group policies through the orchestrator
- **Branch**: `feature/orchestrator-policy-management`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for production use with full testing and documentation

**Implementation Summary:**
