## üìÖ Recent Key Updates

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2025-01-24 | **üîç CONFIGURATION VALIDATION SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive configuration validation system to prevent ARM API failures. Created `Test-EasyPIMConfigurationValidity.ps1` with auto-correction for field name mismatches (id‚ÜíId, description‚ÜíName), missing approvers detection, and template reference validation. Integrated into orchestrator pipeline with user-friendly error reporting. This prevents the ARM API 400 Bad Request errors caused by configuration format issues and improves overall user experience. |
| 2025-09-03 | **üö® CRITICAL DRIFT DETECTION FIX**: Discovered and fixed critical bug in `Test-PIMPolicyDrift` where drift detection showed false "Match" results for Azure resource policies. Root cause: drift detection was always querying subscription-level policies while orchestrator applied resource-specific policies, causing scope validation mismatches. Fixed by implementing scope-aware policy validation in drift detection. Orchestrator bumped to v1.2.0. This resolves cases where policies like "Contributor" at storage account scopes failed to apply but drift detection incorrectly reported "Match". |
| 2025-09-03 | **Telemetry KeyVault Enhancement**: Enhanced `Send-TelemetryEventFromConfig` with improved debug output and config object validation for KeyVault-based configurations. Added fallback SHA256 identifier creation and comprehensive error handling. |
| 2025-08-31 | **Issue #136 Implementation**: Implemented policy template merge feature allowing users to specify base templates with inline property overrides. Enhanced EntraRoles.Policies, AzureRoles.Policies, and GroupRoles.Policies sections to copy non-Template properties as overrides when Template is specified. **Dependency Optimization**: Removed unnecessary `Microsoft.Graph.Identity.Governance` requirement from orchestrator module after code analysis showed it only uses `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` cmdlets. |
| 2025-08-30 | **Issue #137**: Created branch `feature/issue-137-protected-roles-override` to implement -Force flag for overriding protected roles in orchestrator. Issue #138 confirmed resolved in v2.0.5. |
| 2025-08-29 | **CI/CD Reliability**: Added proactive Gallery version checking to prevent repeated pipeline failures. Core bumped to v2.0.5. |
| 2025-08-29 | **Documentation**: Updated Step-by-step Guide for module split architecture with installation and authentication guidance. |
| 2025-08-28 | **Stable Release**: Promoted to stable versions, removed prerelease tags. Module separation milestone achieved. |
| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2025-01-24 | **üîß CRITICAL KEY VAULT COMPATIBILITY FIX**: Released EasyPIM Core v2.0.13 with comprehensive Key Vault secret retrieval fix. Implemented robust multi-method compatibility (SecretValueText ‚Üí ConvertFrom-SecureString ‚Üí Marshal) to resolve "Unexpected end when reading JSON" errors across diverse PowerShell and Azure environments. Added Az.KeyVault version detection, comprehensive error handling, and detailed logging. This resolves Key Vault retrieval failures that prevented configuration loading in production environments. |
| 2025-01-24 | **üîç CONFIGURATION VALIDATION SYSTEM**: Released EasyPIM.Orchestrator v1.2.1 with comprehensive configuration validation system. Created `Test-EasyPIMConfigurationValidity.ps1` with auto-correction for field name mismatches (id‚ÜíId, description‚ÜíName), missing approvers detection, and template reference validation. Integrated into orchestrator pipeline with user-friendly error reporting. This prevents ARM API 400 Bad Request errors caused by configuration format issues and improves overall user experience. |

### **Key Technical Discoveries**

- **Key Vault Compatibility Issue (Jan 24, 2025)**: Resolved critical Key Vault secret retrieval failures
  - **Root Cause**: Az.KeyVault module compatibility issues with `ConvertFrom-SecureString -AsPlainText` returning empty strings
  - **Impact**: Configuration loading failed with "Unexpected end when reading JSON" errors
  - **Solution**: Implemented robust multi-method approach with comprehensive fallbacks and error handling
  - **Methods**: SecretValueText (older versions) ‚Üí ConvertFrom-SecureString (newer versions) ‚Üí Marshal (maximum compatibility)

- **Configuration Validation System (Jan 24, 2025)**: Proactive error prevention for ARM API issues
  - **Purpose**: Prevent ARM API 400 Bad Request errors through configuration validation
  - **Features**: Field name mapping (id‚ÜíId, description‚ÜíName), template validation, missing approvers detection
  - **Integration**: Built into orchestrator pipeline with user-friendly error reporting and auto-correction
  - **Impact**: Eliminates common configuration errors before they reach ARM API

- **Critical Bug Found (Sept 3, 2025)**: Discovered scope mismatch bug in `Test-PIMPolicyDrift` causing false "Match" reports
  - **Root Cause**: Drift detection queried subscription-level policies while orchestrator applied resource-specific policies
  - **Impact**: Azure resource policies (e.g., Contributor at storage account scope) would fail to apply but drift showed "Match"
  - **Solution**: Enhanced drift detection to use policy's specific scope for validation
  - **Evidence**: 400 Bad Request on policy apply vs "Match" in drift detection for same role

### **Module Architecture Understanding**

- **Two-Module System**: EasyPIM Core (individual functions) + Orchestrator (comprehensive workflows)
- **Internal Function Duplication**: Orchestrator embeds needed internal functions to avoid shared dependencies
- **Scope Handling**: Azure policies validated at specific resource scopes vs subscription defaults
- **Telemetry System**: Supports both file-based and KeyVault-based configurations with PostHog integration
- **Configuration Validation**: Comprehensive validation system with auto-correction for common format issues

### **Configuration Validation System**

- **Purpose**: Prevent ARM API 400 errors through proactive configuration validation
- **Auto-Correction**: Fixes field name mismatches (id‚ÜíId, description‚ÜíName, desc‚ÜíName)
- **Validation Categories**: Field mappings, missing approvers, invalid template references
- **Integration**: Built into orchestrator pipeline with user-friendly error reporting
- **Error Prevention**: Catches configuration issues before ARM API calls

### **Build & CI/CD Patterns**

- **Version Strategy**: Core v2.0.13 (released), orchestrator v1.2.1 (released) with critical fixes
- **Publishing**: Tag-based for core (`core-v*`), manual/commit for orchestrator
- **Gallery Integration**: Proactive version checking prevents CI failures
- **Validation**: 6,964 tests must pass for release readiness

### **Security & Governance**

- **Protected Roles**: Global Admin, Security Admin blocked by default with override capability
- **Telemetry Consent**: Strict opt-in model (ALLOW_TELEMETRY: true required)
- **Audit Logging**: Policy changes logged with timestamps and change tracking
- **Scope Validation**: Different Azure resource scopes have different validation rules

### **Troubleshooting Insights**

- **Key Vault Issues**: Use robust multi-method retrieval (SecretValueText ‚Üí ConvertFrom-SecureString ‚Üí Marshal)
- **Configuration Errors**: Leverage `Test-EasyPIMConfigurationValidity` for proactive validation and auto-correction
- **ARM API Errors**: 400 Bad Request often indicates field name mismatches (id‚ÜíId, description‚ÜíName) or scope issues
- **False Positives**: Drift detection can give false "Match" if scope validation differs
- **Configuration Inheritance**: Templates merge with inline overrides for policy customization
- **Authentication Context**: Auto-removes MFA requirements to prevent conflicts (MfaAndAcrsConflict)
- **Configuration Issues**: Use `Test-EasyPIMConfigurationValidity` for proactive error detection

### **Development Workflow**

- **Module Testing**: Import with explicit paths for development: `Import-Module ./EasyPIM.Orchestrator/EasyPIM.Orchestrator.psd1 -Force`
- **Build Validation**: Always run `.\build\vsts-validate.ps1` before committing
- **Version Management**: Core and orchestrator modules versioned independently
- **Release Process**: Tag-based publishing with descriptive commit messages

## üîß Technical Implementation Guide

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `version 'X.Y.Z' is already available` | Version already published | Bump version in manifest |
| False "Match" in drift detection | Scope mismatch between detection and application | Use scope-aware validation |
| KeyVault telemetry not working | Missing config object support | Use `Send-TelemetryEventFromConfig` |
| 400 Bad Request on policy apply | Azure scope-specific validation rules | Check policy compatibility with target scope |

### **Validation Workflow**

**Before Publishing**:
1. ‚úÖ Run local build with `-SkipPublish` flag
2. ‚úÖ Test module import: `Import-Module ./output/ModuleName`
3. ‚úÖ Verify function availability: `Get-Command -Module ModuleName`
4. ‚úÖ Check for syntax errors in generated `.psm1`
5. ‚úÖ Validate dependencies resolve correctly

**After Publishing**:
1. ‚úÖ Verify module appears on PowerShell Gallery
2. ‚úÖ Test installation: `Install-Module ModuleName -Force`
3. ‚úÖ Validate functionality in clean environment

### **GitHub Actions Integration**

**Core Module**: Tag-based publishing (`build-core-tag.yml`)
- Triggered by tags matching `core-v*` pattern
- Automatically builds and publishes to PowerShell Gallery
- Uses repository secrets for API key

**Orchestrator Module**: Tag-based publishing (`build-orchestrator.yml`)
- Triggered by tags matching `orchestrator-v*` pattern
- Automatic trigger on orchestrator file changes
- Validates dependencies before publishing
